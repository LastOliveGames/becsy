### Upcoming
- Allow duplicate component and system types in world defs.  They'll be deduplicated automatically, though only one copy of a system type is allowed to have initial props specified.
- Record some basic stats about systems in `World.stats`.
- Accept a scheduling definition function in the `@system` decorator.  This is equivalent to but requires less boilerplate than invoking `this.schedule` in the system itself.
- Fix `@system` decorator not adding system to world defs if it was passed an argument.

### 0.9.1
- Fix crash when using backref fields in components with an elastic storage type.

### 0.9.0
- Made `System.initialize` non-async, and added a new `System.prepare` method that is async and gets called first, but isn't allowed to touch entities.  This split was necessary because JS doesn't have a way to carry a context across async calls â€” Node has `async_hooks` but there's no browser equivalent.
- `System.prepare` methods are run concurrently in accordance with the systems' schedules.  This can help improve performance on load.

### 0.8.4
- Fixed `System.initialize` to not invalidate entities immediately upon creation.

### 0.8.3
- Made `enum`s non-`const` so they don't break in builds with isolated modules.

### 0.8.2
- Added `Entity.hold` and `Entity.isSame` methods.
- Stopped returning `this` from `Entity.add` and `Entity.addAll`.  This is technically a breaking change and ought to be a major version bump, but it feels so trivial I didn't want to bother.
- Started checking that `Entity` objects obtained from queries are not used for too long.  This reduced create/delete entity performance by 50% in dev mode, but didn't affect perf mode (where the check is bypassed).
- Fixed `System.attach` to return actual system, not an internal handle.
- Documented `Entity` class.

### 0.8.1
- Improved query performance as the number of components grows.  This actually reduced performance on some of the synthetic benchmarks but should have a greatly positive effect in actual applications.
- Improved performance of component initialization, both with and without custom field values.
- Documented query builder and query object.

### 0.8.0
- Implemented automatic ordering of systems for execution.  Systems will *not* be executed in order of definition any more!  You'll need to read the docs for `System.schedule` and add scheduling constraints to your systems.  (You can also schedule whole groups at a time, which can come in handy! Don't forget that `@system` takes an optional group argument to easily group systems together.)
- The execution order gets logged to the console on startup when running in dev mode (unless `NODE_ENV=test` or `production`).  This should help you debug ordering issues.  Eventually, I'd like to draw the actual precedence graph but that's trickier.

### 0.7.0
- Renamed `all` to `current` in queries.
- Fixed issue with resurrected then re-removed components being freed prematurely.
- Merged entity deletion and component removal logs, so the `maxLimboEntities` world parameter is redundant and has been removed.
- Fixed entity creation to record a shape change, so that a component-less entity can satisfy queries.
- Refactored shape tracking arrays to prepare for multithreading.  This caused a 5%-15% performance impact on some workloads in the perf version.

### 0.6.1
- Exported `@system`.

### 0.6.0
- Fixed reactive queries.
- Exported `SystemGroup`.
- Made `@component` decorator automatically add the class to a new world's defs.
- Added a `@system` decorator to automatically add systems to a new world's defs, and optionally group them.
- Changed default component storage strategy to `packed` and elastic.  This will use less memory but decrease performance.  You can change the storage strategy back to the old `sparse` either by setting a component type's `storage` option, or by passing `defaultComponentStorage: 'sparse'` to the world options.

### 0.5.2
- Fixed bug in `weakObject` type.
- Fixed system groups.

### 0.5.1
- Only using `SharedArrayBuffer`s when running in multithreaded mode for maximum compatibility with browsers in singlethreaded mode.
- Added `world.createCustomExecutor` API for applications where not every system gets executed every turn (and some get executed more than once).
- Wrote a lot of doc comments for API methods.

### 0.5.0
- Renamed `@prop` to `@field`.
- Removed `suspend` option from `world.control` options.  I don't think suspension can be implemented given becsy's design.
- Enforced valid use of component instances obtained with `entity.read` and `entity.write`.  This slows down the dev version of becsy by 65%-70%, but the consequences of misusing the component instances would be catastrophic.  The perf version's performance is unaffacted.
- Made world creation and execution async.  You'll need to use `World.create` instead of directly calling the constructor, and await the result of both creating and executing the world.
- Added `system.attach` to create a reference to another system in the same world.
