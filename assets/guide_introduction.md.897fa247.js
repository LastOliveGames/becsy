It&#39;s inspired by <a href="https://github.com/ecsyjs/ecsy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ECSY</a> and <a href="https://github.com/NateTheGreatt/bitECS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bitecs</a>, and guided by <a href="https://ajmmertens.medium.com/why-vanilla-ecs-is-not-enough-d7ed4e3bebe5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ideas from Flecs</a>.</p><div class="danger custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">WARNING</p><p>Becsy is currently in 0.x status. What&#39;s there is reasonably well tested but many features are still missing and you can expect frequent API changes. Most importantly, <strong>multi-threading is not yet implemented</strong>.</p></div><h2 id="priorities" tabindex="-1">Priorities <a class="header-anchor" href="#priorities" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Becsy positions itself within the wider ecosystem of ECS frameworks with the following set of priorities:</p><ol><li>Multi-threaded: all apps developed with Becsy can be effectively run on multiple threads with minimal or no modifications from their single-threaded version. I believe that multi-threading is the only way to scale performance and that ECS is the ideal architecture for making multi-threading effortless and practical in JavaScript.</li><li>Ergonomic: the API is powerful, expressive, and safe, rather than minimal or low-level. I believe that developers choose TypeScript / JavaScript because it&#39;s a high level language, where they can express ideas quickly and succinctly. If they need to prioritize performance they&#39;ll pick a language and ECS implementation better suited to that objective.</li><li>Performant: the point above notwithstanding, Becsy does its best not to unnecessarily leave potential performance on the table. I believe that a good ECS should be usable for more than just toy apps.</li></ol><p>The priorities above are ordered from most to least important. This means that I&#39;ll sacrifice ergonomics if required to support multi-threading, and accept decreased performance in favor of a better API.</p><h2 id="features" tabindex="-1">Features <a class="header-anchor" href="#features" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>From ECSY we take:<br> \u2705 a friendly object-oriented API for both JS and TS clients<br> \u2705 multiple queries per system<br> \u2705 reactive queries (rather than event callbacks)<br> \u2705 explicit mutation tracking<br> \u2705 references to native JS objects in components<br> \u2705 comprehensive docs<br></p><p>From bitecs we take:<br> \u2705 extensive use of <code>ArrayBuffer</code> for performance<br> \u2705 a sparse array architecture<br> \u2705 Node and browser compatibility with no dependencies<br></p><p>Then we add:<br> \u2705 a native TypeScript implementation<br> \u2705 selectable component storage strategies<br> \u2705 bidirectional entity references with strong referential integrity<br> \u2705 declarative system ordering based on data dependencies<br> \u2705 coroutines for more natural multi-stage workflows<br> \u2705 built-in support for representing state machines (per <a href="https://ajmmertens.medium.com/why-storing-state-machines-in-ecs-is-a-bad-idea-742de7a18e59" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sander Mertens</a>)<br> \u2705 weak references to native JS objects, for better integration with other frameworks<br></p><p>Still to come:<br> \u2B1C multithreaded system execution<br> \u2B1C an optional but nicely integrated networked data replication system<br></p><h2 id="support" tabindex="-1">Support <a class="header-anchor" href="#support" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>I&#39;m actively supporting this package but it&#39;s not my primary job, so responses may take 24-48 hours and fixes up to 1-2 weeks (but usually much faster).
